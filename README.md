# USB Worm Protection
USB Worm Protection provides you with an easy and highly efficient way to scan your hard
disk and USB devices for computer worms. This reliable and intuitive piece of software
is a great tool for every computer user that wants to protect their systems against
these types of malware programs.

USB Worm Protection is a simple-to-use program designed to rid your USB flash disks of
files infected with worms. It packs several handy features that can be figured out even
by users with little or no experience in antivirus systems.

At initialization, the tool creates an icon in the system tray area, where you can access
options and configure settings.

Aside from scanning the USB flash disks, USB Worm Protection is also capable of scanning
your local drives for worms. This process shows the total scanned, detected and suspected
items, start and finish time, and duration. Every detected worm or suspected file can be
deleted, skipped or sent to the quarantine.

As far as program preferences go, you can enable silent scan mode, set the tool to prompt
for an action against suspected files, and configure scan notification options (e.g. remove
slide-in dialogs after the scan is done). A restart of USB Worm Protection is required to
apply the new changes.

The application uses a moderate-to-high amount of CPU and RAM, but it doesn't interrupt user
activity, since it can run silently in the background, alongside other processes.
